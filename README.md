# Ogre-Runner
## [live DEMO](https://ogre-run.netlify.app/)

## General Info
Inspired by the browser game T Rex - Dinosaur from the Google Chrome web browser, I decided to make my own version. I built this game in VanillaJS, HTML and CSS without any extra frameworks. The graphics are displayed in the canvas API.<br/>
